Note:

This example clearly exemplifies the need for measuring predictive performance on test data.
As shown in the obtained scatter plots (Figure 3.2), the quality of the predictions is not good.
In effect, a large number of points are far from the diagonal line (in gray), which denotes the
perfect forecast. Also, the R2 values are close to zero and thus far away from the ideal model
(R2=1.0).
